Hi, my name's Ally! <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

I'm currently an Associate Computational Biologist in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I received my Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I'm passionate about helping biologists to store, analyze, and interpret their data efficiently. <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
